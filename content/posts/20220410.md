Moving to Seattle was exhausting, I began moving my items in the weeks leading up by taking things whenever I visited my mom in her apartment.  Her apartment was a few floors below mine in the same building.  Then in one trip with my dad's pickup truck I brought down my bed and furniture.  I was officially a resident of Seattle.  Although I had grown up just a ferry ride away from my new home it still felt new and uncertain.

The first few weeks I didn't have time to go take photos because of work.  But with my newfound employment and income I bought a new lens!  I got a Tamron 20mm f2.8 from Glazers Camera Store.  I wanted to take more photos of landscapes and the new city I lived in.

The first use the lens got was on a fishing trip with my dad to the Yakima River Canyon.  I captured shots from a new tripod in the passenger seat and of the suspension bridge across the river.
