This was the first time in a long time I went out to specifically take photos.  It was a really nice exercise to clear my head.  I had been feeling lonely after long days working at home.

I started the walk in Westlake with some pictures of building and some portraits of a guy that asked for some photos of himself.  I can't remember his name but he was really nice.

I then put the camera away as I walked through the market because I despise people who take photos in the market and block the sidewalk.  I had been playing with my new telephoto 70-300mm and zoom 28-78mm f2.8.  This set really used all the lenses in my bag.  Although the earlier shots would've probably been better on the 20mm prime.
