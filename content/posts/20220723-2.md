After going out with Nate on Lake Union, Colbi and I made the impulsive decision to go hike the Umptanum Ridge Crest Trail.  It was a really intense hike in the high desert.

The view from the top was breathtaking, I wish I had brought my 20mm again.  But the 28-70mm did a good job anyway.

To make it to the summit I had left Colbi about 200 yards back, and upon my return we took a break to eat and take some goofy photos.

The climb down was almost worse than the one up with how hot it got.
