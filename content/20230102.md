After not taking photos for awhile, I invited cole to take some with me in the park near our house.  It was a really fun set and hit outfit was really funny and it really fit his personality.

After editing the wide-angle photo of my mom I had began to explore using cropping to add to composition of the photo.  I felt like this shot needed more negative space around cole and the repeated pattern of the trees seemed to add it.
