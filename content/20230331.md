Continuing on with Nina anf Grace's visit, we headed to the main attraction of the 10 Things I Hate About You Tour&trade;.  We went to Tacoma for Stadium Highschool.  Taking photos on the steps was so much fun.

I really enjoyed reconnecting with Grace and meeting Nina, it really lightened up my winter.
