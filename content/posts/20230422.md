For a fun weekend get-away my coworkers and I went to the tulip festival in Skagit Valley.  I brought my new Sony a7 IV with my 28-75mm Tamron to take lots of portraits.  Austin and I drove there together, he was great for driving so early in the morning and driving through the crazy traffic.  When we arrived I gave him some coaching on taking photos and ew started off taking photos of eachother.  I did a pretty bad job giving advice without coffee on an early saturday morning, but he took some amazing photos.

Throughout this set I also used a totally new shooting process, I shot both RAW and JPEG.  I shot RAW onto a CFExpress Type A card and JPEG onto an SD Card.  This allows super fast buffer clearing and the ability to share my photos right after taking them which eneded up being critical as all of my friends are screenagers.

The following is my desperate attempt to explain leading lines and get austin to align the horizon with my eyes.
