While Grace and I were "just friends" we planned a trip to Japan together.  On August 17th we landed at Tokyo Narita airport and rode the Narita Express to Shinjuku, then took to the Chuo-Sobu line to arrive at our Airbnb in Okubo.  We were so tired and hungry we begged my friend Austin to come help us find food in Okubo.  We ate BBQ meat skewers and I had my first lemon sour (lemon juice and sho-chu).

Our Airbnb was a tiny little apartment with a traditional bed of tatami mats and a rollout mattress to sleep on.  As a back sleeper I had the best sleep of my life but Grace hated it.  Lying in bed, unwilling to go out in the 100 degree humid heat of urban tokyo I took a photo of Grace, impaitent to go find breakfast.

Grace was starved and we had no experiance ordering in Japanese so we went to a western style breakfast resturant in Shinjuku.  It was probably the worst choice we made the whole trip.  We swore to only eat Gyoza from here on out.

Grace had booked tickets to the Ghibli Museum so we took the Chuo line from Shinjuku.  We were not allowed to take any photos inside so I didn't bring my camera.  Arriving in Mitaka we walked to the museum enjoying the Tokyo urban sprawl.  While waiting for the museum we were appraoched by a group of young schoolboys who practiced their english with us.  Luckily Grace had coerced me to learn basic Japanese so we could communicate with them.

After the Ghibli Museum we walked to a differnt station to get home in Kichijoji.  Before we took the train we stopped in Harmonica Alley where Grace and I ate the best Gyoza we had ever had.  The alley was filled with cramped open hallways with the smallest food vendors imaginable.

That night we layed low, exhaused from the day and the time change we had a simple dinner for the 7/11 on the corner (7/11 is much nicer in Japan than in the United States).

The following day we planned out trip to Mitaka and The Meiji Jingu Shrine.  Staying just north in Okubo we took the train to Transfer to the infamous Yamanote line in Shinjuku Station.  At this point we hadn't spent much time in the Shinjuku Station (busiest train station in the world) and were overwhelmed by the hustle and bustle and went in cirlces looking for our train.  Luckily we identified the signature green of the Yamanote Line and found our train.

Arriving first in Harajuku we were immediatley hit with the realization of how hot it was.  The forecast claimed 96 degrees with 85% humidity.  We hurried past the gates to the shrine to find shade in the trees.

Walking down a wide gravel path we walked past huge casks of Sake, a Japanese alcohol made from rice.  The monks at the temple had decorated them.

After the Sake we reached the second gate and proceeded into the temple around the corner.  I put the camera because of how hot the day was getting, so there are no temple photos.

To cool off we quickly learned of a drink called "Pocari Sweat" it's basically gatorade without flavor.  We began buying it at every vending machine we found, including the one outside the shrine.  We continued exploring the forest surrounding Meiji Jingu to keep cool.  I really enjoyed listening to the cicadias buzzing and the peace and quiet of the forest compared to the noise of the city we had been surrounded by for the past 2 days.

After walking through the forest for awhile we decided to head back to our AirBnB to escape the heat as we were both nearing heat stroke.

When planning dinner we connected with Austin, Riley and Liam and decided to meet up in Ueno for dinner and drinks.  Grace and I rode the train through the center of Tokyo arriving in Ueno and walking to meet the group.

When we met up with the gang I offered to take some photos of them after Austin asked for some new headshots for work.  instead I caught this funny photo of Austin photobombing Riley.

On our return trip to Okubo we really began to apreciate the feeling of the Tokyo metro area.  The feeling of both space and constant change created a sense of plesant urgency.  Nobody was running to get somewhere yet everyone was constantly moving.
