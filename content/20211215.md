I justified another camera toy with this one!  I got a multi-color LED Light Panel.  My goal was to take some photos I had seen on Tik-Tok with subjects highlighted differently with a color to create a contrast from the background.  Instead, I went out in the dark with Miles and got these silly photos.  If either of us ever produces an album, this has to be the cover.
