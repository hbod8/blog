The weekend following the Gorge Regatta was another alumni event.  The Western Sailing Auction and Friends & Family Regatta.  This was just Western alumni and it was a lot more personal as that weekend, Jeff Davis retired.  Jeff was a huge role model to GC and I and seeing him pass the torch was really amazing to see.
