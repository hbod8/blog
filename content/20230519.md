My cousin Joe graduated from Gettysburg College in PA with a Bachelors in History.  The entire family was so proud and happy to see him happy.  It was a real relief to see everything so much back to normal after the pandemic and see the whole family back together again.

Throughout the whole trip I was competing with my Aunt Rachel for photos, so to win the contest I just took the best photos of her.

After seeing Joe graduate, I snuck in an extra trip to go see Grace in DC.  I rode the train from Baltimore and it was so much fun.
