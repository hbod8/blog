On a cloudy sunday I offered my photography services to my roomate Cole and his partner Elle.  This was an interesting set, the cloudiness proved quite a challenge when editing.  Although I have officially swapped editors to Lightroom over RawTherapee and this set was fun but challenging given the new tools I had.

Cole and Elle were fantastic subjects to photograph and their poses were natural.  The first shot was Cole on the link on the way to Capitol Hill.

We then headed up to the reflecting pool to get some better shots of them both.
