Picking up where I left off... Moving to Seattle was exhausting, I began moving my items in the weeks leading up by taking things whenever I visited my mom in her apartment.  Her apartment was a few floors below mine in the same building.  Then in one trip with my dad's pickup truck I brought down my bed and furniture.  I was officially a resident of Seattle.  Although I had grown up just a ferry ride away from my new home it still felt new and uncertain.
