On a cloudy Seattle summer day Jack invited me to go to a wooden boat show in Bell Harbor marina.  He had just bought my old camera and we went with the goal to take photos.  I was greatly dissapointed by my photos, but we had fun either way.

After looking at the boats we headed to Ivars for lunch, while there Jack and I talked cameras and I took some silly photos of him.

After lunch we took the Link to University Village to do some shopping.  On the walk down we went under an overpass and Jack and I joked about taking "edgy" pictures.  So we took them.  I have purposfully omitted mine.
