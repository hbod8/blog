On a Sunday afternoon, Cole, Elle and I all went to the Washington Park Conservatory.  I honestly had gone because I know how much they both love plants and I enjoy spending time with them.  But I was really surprised with how beautiful the plants were.  I also think the photos I took came out really well.  These are my favorite portraits yet.
