Lizi has always been one of my closest friends, she is such a joy to be around.  She always has a smile on her face and such a sense of joy.  She visited me from Bainbridge while she was back visiting her parents.  We went out for dinner in the market and drinks at Rachels Ginger Beer.  We both drank on empty stomachs so the night was short lived as we both got pretty sick.
