This weekend cole and I headed down to Seattle to see a Mt. Joy concert.  We stayed the night at my mom's apartment on First Hill and spent the afternoon walking around Seattle.  Our leading destination was Beechers Cheese and a hot wheels store that Cole wanted to see.

After finishing our Beecher's Mac and Cheese, we took photos on the deck overlooking the Seattle waterfront.  These portraits of Cole were fun to take.  I wasn't confident enough to ask cole to pose for some of these shots.  Cole then took the camera and took photos of me on the railing.

After eating and checking out the Hot Wheels store, we headed back to my mom's apartment, and I continued to take photos in the apartment and on the roof deck.

The concert was terrific, except for the assigned seats and twelve-dollar ciders.
