I began to fill my long summer days with mark set without GC as he had left for Hong Kong and his masters program.  I had also picked up the habit of going into the office to work.  I had quickly made friends in  the office and we often went out on the water together.  Also, Nate, one of my closest friends had just moved back to Seattle and he joined us on many occasions.

On this evening on the water, we left from Elliot Bay and went through the locks to Lake Union.
