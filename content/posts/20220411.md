All settled into my little new apartment!  I tried to capture the small space with my new wide-angle lens, I was quite impressed with the results.

Also, the view from the roof deck looking over Seattle.  The first image faces west towards Elliot Bay.  My commute to work is walking down Madison Avenue everyday which is out of frame but down and to the left.  The second image faces north towards Lake Union, which is the same orientation from my moms apartment.
