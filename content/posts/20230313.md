After re-meeting at a mutual friends funeral, I had become close friends with one of my friends from elementary school, Grace.  She was finishing college in DC and we made sure to hang every time she was back visiting her parents on Bainbridge.  This time she brought her friend Nina and we all went to the zoo and Tacoma together.  Nina's favorite movie is 10 Things I Hate About You, and wanted to see where all the scenes were filmed in Seattle.  So we started the morning at Gas Works Park, unfortunately the weather was not on our side as it rained lightly the whole, time and there was a horrible wind chill.  But being with Grace and Nina was so much fun I kind of forgot about how cold I was.

After getting lunch at Bok A Bok, we headed to Woodland Park Zoo.

Grace really liked the farm animals in the beginning :)

We quickly moved on to the bird exhibits.

The highlight for taking photos was definitely the Jaguar, which we saw right as the park closed.
