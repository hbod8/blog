My grandparents made mid-september visit out to the west coast.  Seeing them was really fnice, we spent a night out on Parlay, my dad's boat.  We anchored off Blake Island, a small island about an hour's sail from Seattle.  I think my brother enjoyed this trip the most, he had his first sip of alcohol and talked back to my dad.  For me, the highlight was seeing my grandparents.  I spent many summers with them growing up and having them out is always a treat.

On the sail out to blake island I captured all of us on the deck of the boat.

The following morning sail back to Seattle we were all quite tired from a long night of jokes in galley.  Cooper slept the entire sail back.
