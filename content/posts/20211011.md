As I was still in Bellingham, being a bum off the remaining savings from my job at CBC, I decided to coach the WWU sailing team on occasion.  Going out on the water again was comforting after missing the opportunity to sail my senior year due to Covid.

This photo of Hatcher roll-tacking is one of my all-time favorites.  If you look closely, you can see his rudder fully out of the water, meaning he had no steerage on the boat other than the hull and the sails.

And Maya being photogenic as always.
