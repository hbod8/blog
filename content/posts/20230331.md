Continuing on with Nina and Grace's visit, we headed to the main attraction of the 10 Things I Hate About You Tour&trade;.  We went to Tacoma for Stadium Highschool.  Taking photos to recreate scenes from the movie where the main character professes their love.

Earlier in the day we had gone to the beach to kill time so we didn't go to the school while it was still open.

I really enjoyed reconnecting with Grace and meeting Nina, it really lightened up my cold and gray PNW winter.
